    "# Face Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will build a face recognition system. Many of the ideas presented here are from [FaceNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf). In lecture, we also talked about [DeepFace](https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/deepface-closing-the-gap-to-human-level-performance-in-face-verification.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "Face recognition problems commonly fall into two categories: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Face Verification** - \"is this the claimed person?\". For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem. \n",
    "- **Face Recognition** - \"who is this person?\". For example, the video lecture showed a [face recognition video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr4rx0Spihs) of Baidu employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify themselves. This is a 1:K matching problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "FaceNet learns a neural network that encodes a face image into a vector of 128 numbers. By comparing two such vectors, you can then determine if two pictures are of the same person.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**In this assignment, you will:**\n",
    "- Implement the triplet loss function\n",
    "- Use a pretrained model to map face images into 128-dimensional encodings\n",
    "- Use these encodings to perform face verification and face recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Channels-first notation\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this exercise, we will be using a pre-trained model which represents ConvNet activations using a **\"channels first\"** convention, as opposed to the \"channels last\" convention used in lecture and previous programming assignments. \n",
    "* In other words, a batch of images will be of shape $(m, n_C, n_H, n_W)$ instead of $(m, n_H, n_W, n_C)$. \n",
    "* Both of these conventions have a reasonable amount of traction among open-source implementations; there isn't a uniform standard yet within the deep learning community. "

    "\n",
    "You'll implement a face recognition system that takes as input an image, and figures out if it is one of the authorized persons (and if so, who). Unlike the previous face verification system, we will no longer get a person's name as one of the inputs. \n",

    "**Exercise**: Implement `who_is_it()`. You will have to go through the following steps:\n",
    "1. Compute the target encoding of the image from image_path\n",
    "2. Find the encoding from the database that has smallest distance with the target encoding. \n",
    "    - Initialize the `min_dist` variable to a large enough number (100). It will help you keep track of what is the closest encoding to the input's encoding.\n",
    "    - Loop over the database dictionary's names and encodings. To loop use `for (name, db_enc) in database.items()`.\n",
    "        - Compute the L2 distance between the target \"encoding\" and the current \"encoding\" from the database.\n",
    "        - If this distance is less than the min_dist, then set `min_dist` to `dist`, and `identity` to `name`."

    "#### Ways to improve your facial recognition model\n",
    "Although we won't implement it here, here are some ways to further improve the algorithm:\n",
    "- Put more images of each person (under different lighting conditions, taken on different days, etc.) into the database. Then given a new image, compare the new face to multiple pictures of the person. This would increase accuracy.\n",
    "- Crop the images to just contain the face, and less of the \"border\" region around the face. This preprocessing removes some of the irrelevant pixels around the face, and also makes the algorithm more robust.\n"

    "## Key points to remember\n",
    "- Face verification solves an easier 1:1 matching problem; face recognition addresses a harder 1:K matching problem. \n",
    "- The triplet loss is an effective loss function for training a neural network to learn an encoding of a face image.\n",
    "- The same encoding can be used for verification and recognition. Measuring distances between two images' encodings allows you to determine whether they are pictures of the same person. "
